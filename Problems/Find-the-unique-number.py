# Probelm Description
"""
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
"""

# Output Examples
"""
find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55

# Problem Solution
